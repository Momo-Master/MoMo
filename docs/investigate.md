Comparative Analysis and Architectural Audit of the "MoMo" Wireless Security Platform: Market Equivalents, Technical Divergences, and Critical DeficienciesExecutive SummaryThe domain of portable wireless security auditing has transitioned from a niche hobbyist pursuit into a rigorous discipline governed by sophisticated, autonomous, and often stealthy hardware platforms. The project designated "MoMo"—identified through technical context as a Raspberry Pi 5-based wireless security audit tool—enters a saturated and highly specialized market. To determine the operational viability, competitive standing, and technical maturity of MoMo, this report conducts an exhaustive, forensic-level comparison against the prevailing "Gold Standards" of the industry.The analysis reveals that the current wireless security landscape is dominated by three distinct archetypes: Autonomous AI Agents (exemplified by the Pwnagotchi), Enterprise-Grade Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Platforms (the WiFi Pineapple), and Microcontroller-Based Multi-Tools (ESP32 Marauder/Flipper Zero). MoMo, by virtue of its projected hardware (Raspberry Pi 5) and software scope, sits at a precarious intersection of these categories. It possesses the raw computational power to outperform them all but currently faces significant architectural risks regarding power efficiency, software orchestration, and advanced threat emulation capabilities—specifically in the realm of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) bypass.Our investigation highlights that while MoMo shares functional DNA with Pwnagotchi (automated handshake capture) and Airgeddon (scripted attacks), it likely lacks the Reinforcement Learning (RL) sophistication of the former and the Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) capabilities of modern phishing suites like Evilginx. Furthermore, the choice of the Raspberry Pi 5 introduces a critical "Power/Mission Mismatch," where the device's high energy consumption precludes the "drop-box" persistence strategies utilized by competitors. This report dissects these findings across technical, architectural, and operational dimensions to provide a roadmap for elevating MoMo from a generic tool to a market-leading platform.1. The Wireless Security Audit Ecosystem: Identification of Market EquivalentsTo accurately benchmark MoMo, it is essential to first map the ecosystem of "equivalents"—tools that perform similar functions but often with vastly different philosophies. The internet hosts a diverse array of projects, ranging from passive surveillance units to active attack platforms. The primary competitors identified for MoMo are categorized by their operational philosophy: AI-Driven Autonomous Agents, Enterprise-Grade Rogue APs, and Microcontroller-Based Multi-Tools.1.1. AI-Driven Autonomous Agents: The Pwnagotchi StandardThe most direct functional equivalent to a portable, automated handshake capture device is the Pwnagotchi. Unlike traditional tools that rely on deterministic scripts or user intervention, Pwnagotchi introduces Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the wireless audit domain, fundamentally changing the "cat and mouse" dynamic of wardriving.1.1.1. Architectural Philosophy and the A2C ModelPwnagotchi is not merely a script; it is an A2C-based (Advantage Actor Critic) artificial intelligence agent. Its primary directive is to maximize the capture of crackable WPA/WPA2 key material (handshakes and PMKIDs) from the surrounding WiFi environment.1 Unlike linear scripts that might dwell on a channel for a fixed duration, the Pwnagotchi's AI learns to tune its parameters dynamically. It adjusts the duration of staying on a channel, the intensity of deauthentication frames, and the timing of association attempts based on the specific electronic environment it inhabits.2This distinction is critical. A standard script (and potentially the current iteration of MoMo) operates on a "blind" loop: scan channel 1, wait 5 seconds, scan channel 6, wait 5 seconds. Pwnagotchi, conversely, observes the "reward" (captured handshakes) and modifies its behavior over epochs (learning cycles). If it learns that a specific environment yields more handshakes with aggressive deauthentication, it adapts. If silence works better, it becomes passive. This stochastic adaptability is a generation ahead of deterministic tools.31.1.2. The "Bettercap" Instrumentation LayerCrucially, Pwnagotchi achieves this by instrumenting Bettercap, a powerful Go-based network attack framework.1 Pwnagotchi itself is a Python application that acts as the "brain," sending commands to the Bettercap "muscle." This separation of concerns is vital: Bettercap handles the low-level, high-speed packet injection and sniffing (where performance is paramount), while the Python layer handles the high-level logic and UI. If MoMo attempts to handle raw packet processing in pure Python without an engine like Bettercap, it risks significant performance bottlenecks, packet loss, and instability.41.1.3. Cooperative "Bonding" and the Parasite ProtocolA unique, often overlooked differentiator of Pwnagotchi is its parasite protocol. Multiple units in close physical proximity can detect each other and "bond" by broadcasting custom information elements embedded in standard 802.11 frames. This allows units to "talk" without connecting to a shared network. Units trained together learn to cooperate, dividing the available channels among themselves to maximize coverage and minimize interference.1 This "swarm intelligence" capability is a sophisticated feature that transforms individual units into a distributed sensor array.1.2. Enterprise Rogue Access Points: The WiFi PineappleWhile Pwnagotchi focuses on capture on the move, the WiFi Pineapple (developed by Hak5) represents the industry standard for Rogue Access Point (AP) and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. It is designed not just to capture handshakes, but to intercept active sessions.1.2.1. The PineAP Suite and Karma/Mana AttacksThe core of the WiFi Pineapple's dominance is the PineAP suite. This software stack automates the harvesting of SSID probe requests from client devices and rebroadcasts them to trick devices into connecting. This is known as the Karma or Mana attack.6Mechanism: When a phone searches for "Home_WiFi," PineAP sees the request and responds, "I am Home_WiFi." The phone connects, and the Pineapple creates a MitM position.Sophistication: PineAP includes advanced filtering to limit collateral damage (scoping attacks to specific MAC addresses) and supports automated "Campaigns" to gather intelligence over time.7 If MoMo relies on simple hostapd configurations without this dynamic response logic, it cannot effectively trap modern devices that use randomized MAC addresses or passive probing.1.2.2. Modular Architecture and Cloud C2The WiFi Pineapple operates on a rigorous module-based system, allowing developers to write extensions in HTML, AngularJS, and PHP (or Python backends on the Mark VII).8 However, the feature that truly separates it from hobbyist tools is Cloud C2. This is a self-hosted command and control dashboard that allows a Red Team operator to deploy a fleet of Pineapples across a target facility, manage them from a central server, and exfiltrate data ("loot") through encrypted backhauls (LTE or WiFi).10 If MoMo is designed for localized, single-device use, it lacks this enterprise-grade scalability which is essential for professional engagements.1.3. Microcontroller Portability: ESP32 MarauderAt the lower end of the power/compute spectrum lies the ESP32 Marauder. Unlike the Linux-based Pi 5 or Pineapple, this tool runs on the ESP32 microcontroller, prioritizing extreme portability and battery life over raw processing power.1.3.1. Efficiency vs. PowerThe Marauder capitalizes on the ESP32's extreme power efficiency. While a Raspberry Pi 5 might consume 2.7W to 5W+ under load 12, an ESP32 operates in the milliwatt range, allowing it to run for weeks on a standard battery or months in deep sleep.13 This enables "plant-and-forget" scenarios that are impossible with a Raspberry Pi 5.1.3.2. Attack Vector Specialization: BLE and "Rickrolling"The Marauder differentiates itself by specializing in "noisy" or nuisance attacks that do not require heavy computation. This includes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) spamming (such as the "Sour Apple" attack against iOS devices or Samsung BLE spam) and WiFi deauthentication floods.15 It serves a tactical purpose of disruption or distraction, whereas Pwnagotchi and Pineapple are focused on stealth and interception.1.4. Software Frameworks: Airgeddon and WifiphisherIf MoMo is fundamentally a software suite running on general-purpose hardware (like a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux), its direct equivalents are the software frameworks Airgeddon and Wifiphisher.Airgeddon: A multi-use bash script that acts as a wrapper for underlying tools like aircrack-ng, hostapd, and mdk4. It automates handshake capture, Evil Twin creation, and WPS attacks through a text-based menu system.17 It is robust but deterministic—it follows a linear flowchart of actions.Wifiphisher: A Python-based framework specifically designed for automated social engineering. It instigates a Man-in-the-Middle attack by deauthenticating users from their legitimate AP and spawning a rogue twin, serving phishing templates to capture credentials.19 It is specialized for the "human element" of the attack chain.2. Architectural Comparative Analysis: MoMo vs. The IndustryHaving identified the market equivalents, we must now rigorously analyze the divergence between MoMo and these established platforms. This analysis focuses on Hardware Architecture, Software Stack, and Operational Methodology.2.1. Hardware Platform: The Raspberry Pi 5 DilemmaThe research indicates that MoMo is likely utilizing or considering the Raspberry Pi 5.21 This hardware choice immediately creates a massive divergence from the Pwnagotchi (Pi Zero) and Marauder (ESP32), fundamentally altering the tool's profile.2.1.1. Power Consumption and the "Mission Time" ProblemThe most critical differentiator is power. Pwnagotchi is typically built on a Raspberry Pi Zero W or Zero 2 W, devices with minimal power draw.Pi Zero W Profile: Operates at ~100-200mA (0.5W - 1W). A 20,000mAh battery can power it for 2-3 days.Raspberry Pi 5 Profile: Benchmarks indicate an idle power consumption of approximately 2.7 Watts (540mA), rising to 6.4 Watts (1280mA) under CPU load.12 Even at idle, it consumes 5x the power of a Pi Zero.Calculated Impact: A standard 20,000mAh power bank (effectively ~74Wh at 3.7V, converted to 5V with ~80% efficiency) provides roughly 59Wh of usable energy.Pwnagotchi (1W): ~59 hours of runtime.MoMo (Pi 5 @ 4W avg): ~14 hours of runtime.23Insight: This drastic reduction in runtime shifts MoMo's use case from "surveillance/persistence" (hiding it in a ceiling) to "active auditing" (carried in a backpack for a day job). It cannot compete as a "drop box" without massive external batteries.2.1.2. Native Monitor Mode Support (The Nexmon Advantage)A historical barrier for Raspberry Pi-based tools was the internal WiFi chip's inability to enter Monitor Mode (promiscuous mode) or perform Packet Injection. Users were forced to use bulky external USB adapters (like ALFA cards via Realtek/Mediatek chipsets).The MoMo Advantage: Recent updates to Kali Linux (2025.1+) have reintroduced robust Nexmon support for the Raspberry Pi 5's internal Broadcom chip.25 This allows MoMo to perform injection and monitoring natively, without external dongles.Comparison: This gives MoMo a form-factor advantage over older "Airgeddon on a laptop" setups or even older Pi 3/4 setups that required USB cards. It allows for a "clean," self-contained unit, similar to the Pwnagotchi but with vastly more processing power.2.2. Software Architecture: Python vs. GoThe choice of programming language dictates the performance ceiling of the tool, particularly for network-intensive tasks.2.2.1. The Python Constraint (Pwnagotchi/MoMo)Pwnagotchi and Wifiphisher are primarily written in Python, leveraging asyncio for event handling.20 While Python allows for rapid development and a rich plugin ecosystem, it suffers from performance limitations in high-throughput packet processing due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and interpretation overhead.27Throughput Benchmarks: Research indicates that Go (Golang) can handle significantly higher request throughput. In comparative benchmarks for web services (relevant for Captive Portals), Go processed 15,000 requests per second compared to Python's 1,300 requests per second—an 11.6x difference.272.2.2. The Go Advantage (Bettercap/Evilginx)Bettercap, the engine underlying Pwnagotchi, is written in Go. This is not a coincidence. Go allows Bettercap to handle the heavy lifting of packet injection, sniffing, and parsing with near-C performance while maintaining memory safety. Similarly, Evilginx2, the premier phishing proxy, was rewritten in Go to handle complex, concurrent connections required for real-time session token capture.30Implication for MoMo: If MoMo's core logic (packet handling, proxying) is written in pure Python without offloading to a Go/C engine (like Bettercap), it will likely suffer from latency and packet loss under high load, especially during complex MitM attacks involving multiple victims.2.3. Operational Methodology: AI vs. Deterministic Scripting2.3.1. Deterministic (Old School)Tools like Airgeddon and Wifiphisher operate deterministically. The user selects a target, selects an attack (e.g., Deauth), and the tool executes the command loop until stopped. This requires constant human attention and decision-making.2.3.2. Stochastic/AI (New School)Pwnagotchi differs by using RL (Reinforcement Learning). It observes the environment (State), performs an action, observes the result (Reward), and updates its Policy.MoMo's Opportunity: With the Raspberry Pi 5's quad-core Cortex-A76 processor, MoMo has vastly more compute power than the Pi Zero. It could theoretically run much more complex AI models—perhaps even Transformer-based traffic analysis or local LLMs for analyzing captured packets in real-time—whereas Pwnagotchi is limited to simple LSTM models.3 If MoMo does not leverage this compute power for AI, it is effectively wasting the hardware's potential.3. Critical Deficiency Analysis: What is MoMo Missing?Based on the capabilities of the "Gold Standard" tools, we can identify specific, critical deficiencies in a generic "MoMo" project design that relies on standard approaches. These gaps represent the difference between a "hobby project" and a "professional tool."3.1. Deficiency 1: The MFA Gap (Lack of Evilginx Integration)Traditional phishing tools included in frameworks like Wifiphisher or Airgeddon typically rely on Credential Harvesting—tricking a user into entering a username and password into a fake portal.19 However, in the modern security landscape, this is insufficient. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) renders simple credential harvesting obsolete.3.1.1. The Mechanism of DefeatIf a victim enters credentials into MoMo's fake portal, the real service (e.g., Google, Microsoft 365) will request an SMS code, Authenticator app token, or Hardware Key (YubiKey). If MoMo is just a static web server, it cannot proxy this request. The attack fails.3.1.2. The Competitor Standard: Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)Professional tools use Evilginx2 or Evilginx3. These operate as AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle) proxies.How it Works: They do not just copy the login page; they act as a transparent relay between the victim and the real site. When the user enters their 2FA code, the proxy forwards it to the real site. The real site validates the login and issues a Session Cookie. Evilginx captures this cookie.32The "Loot": With the Session Cookie, the attacker can import it into their own browser and access the victim's account without needing the password or 2FA code.MoMo's Deficiency: If MoMo uses static templates (standard Airgeddon/Wifiphisher templates) 17, it is functionally obsolete against any secured target. It must integrate a dynamic reverse-proxy engine capable of rewriting packet headers and handling TLS termination in real-time.303.2. Deficiency 2: Absence of Centralized Command and Control (C2)For professional security audits or "Red Team" engagements, a single standalone device is operationally limiting. An operator might need to plant five devices across a corporate campus.The Competitor Standard: The WiFi Pineapple leverages Cloud C2.6 This allows the auditor to sit off-site (or in a van) and manage all deployed devices through a unified web dashboard. They receive "loot" (handshakes/creds) instantly and can reconfigure attacks on the fly.Pwnagotchi's Approach: Pwnagotchi uses PwnGRID, a gamified API that tracks global stats and allows for "bonding" between units, creating a distributed mesh of awareness.34MoMo's Deficiency: If MoMo requires the user to physically retrieve the device or connect via local SSH to view logs 36, it fails the scalability test. It lacks an LTE/4G exfiltration channel or a centralized "mothership" server architecture, limiting it to single-operator, single-device scenarios.3.3. Deficiency 3: Inadequate Power Optimization for the Hardware ChoiceAs analyzed in Section 2.1, using a Raspberry Pi 5 introduces a severe power penalty.The Competitor Standard: The ESP32 Marauder or Pwnagotchi (Pi Zero) typically run for 24+ hours on standard batteries. This allows for Persistence—hiding the device in a potted plant or drop ceiling to collect data over days.MoMo's Deficiency: A Pi 5-based MoMo will deplete its power source in 4-8 hours. This prohibits "drop-box" operations. Unless MoMo implements advanced power management (e.g., using a low-power co-processor like an ESP32 to wake the Pi 5 only when a target is seen), the hardware choice limits the tool's operational envelope to "active wardriving" only.243.4. Deficiency 4: Limited Protocol Diversity (BLE/Zigbee)Modern attack surfaces extend beyond WiFi (802.11).The Competitor Standard: The ESP32 Marauder and Flipper Zero have native support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) attacks. They can perform "Sour Apple" attacks (crashing iOS devices), "Samsung BLE Spam," and connect to IoT peripherals.15 Kali NetHunter also integrates Software-Defined Radio (SDR) support (RTL-SDR) to scan for ADS-B, pager traffic, and sub-GHz remotes.38MoMo's Deficiency: If MoMo focuses solely on WiFi (WPA2/WPA3), it misses the vast and growing vector of IoT vulnerabilities accessible via Bluetooth and Zigbee. An "exhaustive" security tool in 2025 must be multi-spectral. The Pi 5 has Bluetooth hardware, but without specific software stacks (like bluez weaponization or uber-tooth integration), it remains underutilized.4. Architectural Recommendations for "MoMo"To elevate MoMo from a generic clone to a competitive, expert-level platform, the following architectural pivots are recommended. These recommendations directly address the identified deficiencies.4.1. Hybrid Processing Architecture (The "Wake-on-Threat" Model)To solve the battery life deficiency of the Pi 5, MoMo should adopt a hybrid approach.Implementation: Integrate a low-power microcontroller (ESP32 or Pi Pico W) as a "Sentry."Workflow: The Pi 5 remains in a deep sleep/shutdown state. The ESP32 (consuming milliwatts) continuously scans the airwaves. When the ESP32 detects a high-value target (specific SSID, specific MAC address, or a handshake exchange), it triggers a GPIO pin to wake the Pi 5.Result: The Pi 5 boots, performs the heavy-duty attack (cracking, MitM), saves the data, and shuts down. This extends battery life from hours to days/weeks, matching the persistence of the Marauder while keeping the power of the Pi 5.4.2. Implementation of AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle)MoMo must abandon static phishing templates.Action: Integrate evilginx2 (or the newer evilginx3) binaries into the MoMo distribution.Integration: Create a Python wrapper (using subprocess or RPC) to control Evilginx from the MoMo UI. This wrapper should automate the generation of "lures" (phishing links) and handle the importation of "Phishlets" (YAML configurations for specific targets like Outlook, Okta, Gmail).39Outcome: This capability upgrades MoMo from a "Credential Harvester" to a "Session Hijacker," capable of defeating MFA.4.3. Transition to Asynchronous ArchitectureThe control loop of MoMo should leverage Python's AsyncIO or be partially rewritten in Go.Reasoning: Asynchronous operations allow the tool to handle the web UI, packet injection, GPS logging, and LED indicators concurrently without blocking the main thread. This is crucial for maintaining a responsive user interface while simultaneously flooding a network with deauth packets. Blocking I/O (synchronous code) is the primary cause of UI freeze in tools like Airgeddon when under load.284.4. Community-Driven Plugin SystemPwnagotchi’s longevity is due to its plugin system.26 MoMo should expose a standard API for developers to write plugins.Structure: Create callbacks such as on_handshake_captured, on_peer_detected, on_internet_available, and on_ui_update.Benefit: This allows the community to build integrations (e.g., automatically uploading handshakes to Discord, Telegram, or cracking rigs like OnlineHashCrack) without the core developer needing to maintain every single feature. It decentralizes innovation.5. Detailed Competitor Feature MatrixThe following table synthesizes the comparison, highlighting exactly where MoMo currently stands (based on a standard Pi 5 implementation) versus where the market leaders operate.Feature CategoryPwnagotchi (Pi Zero)WiFi Pineapple (Mark VII)ESP32 MarauderMoMo (Projected Pi 5 Base)Primary GoalPassive/Active Handshake CaptureMan-in-the-Middle (MitM) & Rogue APPortable Offensive ToolHybrid Wireless AuditCore EngineBettercap (Go) + Python AIPineAP (Proprietary/PHP/JS)Arduino/C++Unknown (Likely Python/Kali)AI CapabilitiesYes (A2C Reinforcement Learning)No (Deterministic)NoUnknown (Deficiency if absent)MFA BypassNo (Focus is WPA cracking)Yes (Via Evil Portal/Modules)NoCritical Gap (Needs Evilginx)Battery LifeHigh (24h+ on 5000mAh)Moderate (Dependent on usage)Extreme (Days/Weeks)Low (<5h on 5000mAh)Remote MgmtLocal Only / PwnGRID StatsCloud C2 (Enterprise Class)Screen/WebUI LocalLocal WebUI/SSHDisplayE-Ink (Low refresh, high style)None (WebUI managed)TFT TouchscreenWebUI or HDMI (Overkill)ProtocolsWiFi (2.4/5GHz)WiFi (2.4/5GHz)WiFi + Bluetooth (BLE)WiFi (Need dongle for BLE/SDR)Monitor ModeExternal or Nexmon (Pi Zero)Native (MTK/Realtek chips)Native (ESP32)Native (Pi 5 via Nexmon)6. Deep Dive: The Importance of the Plugin System (Learning from Pwnagotchi)One of the most valuable insights derived from the Pwnagotchi ecosystem is the power of a modular plugin architecture. The Pwnagotchi does not attempt to do everything in its core code. Instead, it defines a lifecycle of events that plugins can hook into.6.1. Event-Driven DesignPwnagotchi's config.toml allows users to enable/disable plugins easily. The core system broadcasts events.Example: The grid.py plugin listens for on_handshake. When triggered, it doesn't just save the file locally; it transmits the metadata to the global PwnGRID server.26MoMo Application: MoMo should replicate this. If a user wants to integrate a GPS module, they shouldn't need to rewrite the main scanning loop. They should simply write a gps.py plugin that hooks into on_packet_received to log coordinates.6.2. Third-Party EcosystemThe pwnagotchi-plugins repository is vast, containing tools for everything from "exp" systems (RPG elements) to integration with specialized UPS batteries (PiSugar, UPS Lite).41Deficiency Impact: If MoMo is a monolithic script, users cannot easily add support for new hardware (like a specific e-ink screen or battery HAT) without forking the project. This fragments the community. A plugin system unifies development and extends the tool's lifespan.7. Legal and Operational Considerations7.1. Geofencing and WhitelistingA critical "deficiency" in many open-source hacking tools is the lack of safety rails.Safeguard: MoMo should implement rigorous whitelisting (only attacking specific SSIDs) and geofencing (disabling attacks if GPS coordinates move outside a designated testing zone). This is a feature often found in enterprise drone jammers and advanced security tools but missing in hobbyist gear. Adding this elevates MoMo to a "Professional Compliance Tool" status.7.2. The "Active" vs. "Passive" Legal DistinctionPwnagotchi operates largely in a "grey" area by emphasizing passive sniffing (listening). Active deauthentication (kicking users off) is illegal in many jurisdictions without consent.43MoMo's Stance: To be a viable professional tool, MoMo must clearly distinguish between "Passive Monitoring Mode" (legal in more contexts) and "Active Engagement Mode" (illegal without consent), perhaps requiring an explicit "safety disengage" confirmation from the user before enabling deauth frames.8. ConclusionThe "MoMo" project, conceptualized as a Raspberry Pi 5-based wireless security tool, sits on a foundation of immense potential but currently faces significant architectural challenges when compared to the existing market.Equivalents: It competes directly with Pwnagotchi (for automated harvesting) and WiFi Pineapple (for rogue AP attacks), while facing efficiency competition from ESP32 Marauder.Differences: MoMo's key differentiator is the raw power of the Pi 5, which allows for native monitor mode (Nexmon) and potential high-level AI processing, but at the cost of severe power inefficiency.Deficiencies: To evolve from a "script-based tool" to a "platform," MoMo must address the MFA Bypass Gap (via Evilginx), implement Hybrid Power Management (via ESP32 co-processors), and adopt a Plugin Architecture to harness community innovation.By addressing these deficiencies, MoMo can transition from being "another WiFi tool" to a comprehensive Portable Cyber-Physical Audit Station, capable of executing the sophisticated, multi-vector attacks that define the security landscape of 2025.




Yaptığım araştırmaya göre projenizin internetteki benzerleri, temel farkları ve projenizde tespit ettiğim kritik eksiklikler şunlardır:

1. İnternetteki Benzerleri ve Rakipler
Projeniz şu üç ana kategorideki araçlarla doğrudan rekabet ediyor:

Pwnagotchi (En Yakın Benzer):

Benzerlik: Otomatik el sıkışma (handshake) yakalama ve "gezgin" (wardriving) modu.

Fark: Pwnagotchi Yapay Zeka (Reinforcement Learning) kullanır. Ortamı "öğrenir" ve saldırı parametrelerini (ne zaman deauth atacağı, ne zaman bekleyeceği) kendi kendine optimize eder. MoMo ise şu an için daha "deterministik" (belirli kurallara dayalı) görünüyor. Ayrıca Pwnagotchi genellikle Pi Zero üzerinde çalışır ve çok az güç tüketir.

WiFi Pineapple (Sektör Standardı):

Benzerlik: Rogue AP (Evil Twin) ve Man-in-the-Middle (Ortadaki Adam) saldırıları.

Fark: WiFi Pineapple, Cloud C2 (Komuta Kontrol) özelliğine sahiptir. Bir siber güvenlik uzmanı, ofisinden oturarak 10 farklı cihazı uzaktan yönetebilir. MoMo şu an tekil (standalone) bir cihaz gibi duruyor.

ESP32 Marauder:

Benzerlik: Taşınabilirlik ve saldırı çeşitliliği (Deauth, Beacon Spam).

Fark: ESP32 bir mikrodenetleyicidir ve pille haftalarca çalışabilir. Raspberry Pi 5 ise bir bilgisayardır ve pili çok hızlı tüketir.

2. Sizin Projenizin Farkları (Avantaj ve Dezavantajlar)
Avantajı: Saf İşlem Gücü (Raspberry Pi 5) Rakipleriniz (Pi Zero veya ESP32) yakaladıkları şifreleri kırmak için genellikle güçlü bir PC'ye ihtiyaç duyar. MoMo, Raspberry Pi 5'in gücüyle yerel hashcat kırma (on-device cracking) işlemini çok daha hızlı yapabilir. Ayrıca Kali Linux 2025.1 ile gelen Nexmon desteği sayesinde harici bir WiFi adaptörüne ihtiyaç duymadan (dahili çip ile) monitör moda geçebilirsiniz.

Dezavantajı: Enerji Tüketimi (Power Mismatch) En büyük mimari risk burada.

Pwnagotchi (Pi Zero): ~0.5W - 1W güç çeker. 20.000mAh powerbank ile 2-3 gün çalışır.

MoMo (Pi 5): Boşta bile ~2.7W, yük altında 6W+ güç çeker. Aynı powerbank ile en fazla 10-14 saat çalışabilir. Bu durum, cihazı bir yere gizleyip günlerce veri toplamasını (drop-box senaryosu) imkansız kılar.

3. Projenizin Eksikleri (Kritik Analiz)
Sektördeki "Gold Standard" araçlara kıyasla projenizde şu 4 özellik eksik veya geliştirilmeli:

⚠️ 1. MFA Bypass (Evilginx Entegrasyonu Eksikliği)
Şu anki Evil Twin modülünüz (captive portal), kullanıcıdan sadece şifre istiyor gibi görünüyor. Ancak modern hesapların çoğu İki Faktörlü Doğrulama (2FA/MFA) kullanır.

Sorun: Kullanıcı şifresini girse bile, gelen SMS kodunu yakalayamazsanız hesap ele geçirilemez.

Çözüm: Projenize Evilginx2 veya benzeri bir "Adversary-in-the-Middle" (AiTM) proxy aracı entegre etmelisiniz. Bu, sadece şifreyi değil, oturum çerezlerini (session cookies) de çalarak 2FA'yı atlatmanızı sağlar.

⚠️ 2. WPA3 ve SAE Saldırıları
Özellik listenizde WPA3 desteği net değil. Modern WiFi güvenliği WPA3-SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) protokolüne geçiyor.

Sorun: Klasik deauth saldırıları WPA3'te (Protected Management Frames - PMF nedeniyle) çalışmaz.

Çözüm: WPA3 Downgrade saldırıları veya OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption) geçiş saldırıları eklemelisiniz. hcxdumptool bu konuda yeteneklidir, entegrasyonu derinleştirilmeli.

⚠️ 3. Filo Yönetimi (C2 Architecture)
WiFi Pineapple'ın en büyük satış noktası, birden fazla cihazı tek ekrandan yönetebilmektir.

Eksik: Eğer MoMo'yu bir şirketin farklı katlarına yerleştirirseniz, hepsine tek tek SSH ile bağlanmak zorunda kalırsınız.

Çözüm: Basit bir Merkezi Komuta Sunucusu (C2) veya bir web paneli (Dashboard) ekleyerek, birden fazla MoMo cihazının verilerini tek bir havuzda toplamasını sağlamalısınız.

⚠️ 4. Hibrit Güç Yönetimi (Uyku Modu)
Pi 5'in yüksek güç tüketimini dengelemek için donanımsal bir "uyandırıcı"ya ihtiyacınız var.

Öneri: Sisteme ucuz bir ESP32 ekleyerek Pi 5'i kapalı tutabilir, ESP32 "ilginç" bir WiFi ağı gördüğünde Pi 5'i GPIO üzerinden tetikleyerek uyandırabilir. Bu "Wake-on-Threat" mimarisi pil ömrünü 10 saatten 1 haftaya çıkarabilir.

Özet Tavsiye
MoMo, "Taşınabilir bir süper bilgisayar" gibi. Onu rakiplerinden ayırmak için yerel yapay zeka (Pi 5'in gücünü kullanarak yerel LLM veya trafik analizi) ve MFA Bypass özelliklerine odaklanmalısınız. Pwnagotchi'nin "sevimli" yapısı ile Pineapple'ın "profesyonel" yapısını birleştirirken, pil ömrü sorununu yazılımsal veya donanımsal optimizasyonla çözmeniz şart.
